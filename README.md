# Source code for Sketchnoting.dev

Hello! sketchnoting.dev is a website made by Miguel Beltran and Lara Martin,
to collect all the sketchnotes we do at conferences and meetups around the world.

We would like to remind you that all the content in this repo, including sketchnotes,
is copyrighted and can't be distributed without our permission.

The theme is originally by bootstrapious.com with MIT license, and has been modified by us.

## Collaborating

Without the work of the speakers that put so much effort on creating their talks we wouldn't
have this website, that's why we want to improve their visibility adding more metadata to our sketchnotes.

We are happy to accept the following contributions:

- Adding speaker info to a talk.
- Adding links to the video recording of a talk.
- Fixing wrong tags or titles.
- Adding the abstract to a talk.

To do so, navigate to https://github.com/miquelbeltran/sketchnoting.dev/tree/master/content/sketchnotes where
you will be able to find the talk you want to improve and send us a Pull-Request modifying the markdown file.
